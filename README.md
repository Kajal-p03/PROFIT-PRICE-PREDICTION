# PROFIT-PRICE-PREDICTION
Predicting the profit based on various business-related factors.

For our prediction model, we chose Linear Regression due to its simplicity and interpretability. Linear Regression helps in understanding the linear relationship between the dependent variable (Profit) and the independent variables (R&D Spend, Administration, etc.).
